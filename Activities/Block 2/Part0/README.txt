NetBeans activity 0: Getting started with NetBeans

Part 0 of Block 1 provided some instructions on how to install the module software. This activity invites you to explore using the software you have installed, and to start experimenting with writing code in the NetBeans IDE (integrated development environment).

Materials

There are three videos to watch, which are located in Task 1 and Task 2 of the NetBeans Activity 0 document on the module website. You should try to reproduce the steps you see in the videos to help you familiarise yourself with the NetBeans IDE, as well as experiment on your own to make sure you are comfortable with the programming environment we will be using.

For reference, two sample projects, called HelloWorld and HelloWeb, are provided in the Solutions folder of the Block 1 activities folder. You do not need to open them yet. You should create your own projects in this activity first.
